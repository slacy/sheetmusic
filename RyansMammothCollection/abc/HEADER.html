This is the set of tunes from the Ryan and Cole collections that have
been transcribed so far.

<form method=GET action=/~jc/cgi/abc/tunelist>
	If you don't have ABC software, and you see a simple list of the files,
	you might like to try a tool that returns the tunes in various formats.
		<input type=hidden name=DIR value=/~jc/music/book/ryan-cole/Tunes/>
		<input type=submit value="Push this button" size=100>
	This will return the page you're looking at now, but the ABC files
	will be expanded to show all the tunes, and each tune will have a
	line of links that will return it in a number of different formats.
</form>
